# The Odds

What follows is a technical overview of how the game makes decisions to determine duel results.

> This is an **strategy guide** for **advanced duelists**.

## Concepts

### Duelist Chances

There is no benefit or disadvantage between **challenger** and **challenged**, both have exactly the same chances.

Cross-game bonuses and penalties based on **Honour** and **Archetype** can influence a duelist chance.

In-game decisions and injuries can also inflict bonuses and penalties.

### Dice Rolls

We call all **randomized decisions** Dice Rolls.

All the chances are expressed in **percentages**, as if we were using an **100-sided dice**.

For example, an action with `40%` chance will be successful when `dice_value <= 40`.

The **seed** for randomization is a hash between the secret salts sent by each duelist.
Since each salt is known only to each player before actions are revealed,
it is impossible to predict game decisions.

### Round Logic

The underneath **logic** for all rounds is the same.
**Pistols** and **blades** are all **actions** that confronted against each other lead to a result.

There are a few steps that determine the result of a round...


## 1. Strike Priority

Who strikes first? The challenger? The challenged? Simultaneously?

### Pistols Round
On a Pistols round, it's very simple to decide...

* The duelist who takes **less paces shoots first**.
* At **the same paces**, a **Trickster** against a non-Trickster will **shoot first**.
* At **the same paces**, duelists shoot **simultaneously**.

First to shoot is called the **Early Duelist**, against the **Late Duelist**.

### Blades Round
Blades follow this priority, on each **strike/slot**...

* **Heavy Blades** strike first for an **Execution** chance (crit).
* **Flee**, **Steal** and **Seppukku** take place.
* Otherwise, blades strike **simultaneously**.


## 2. CRIT Dice Roll

> **CRIT** is the chance of an action to **execute** or inflict **maximum damage** on the opponent.

Executed for the **Early Duelist**, or in parallel for both duelists if shooting simultaneously.

### Action Crit Chances

Each action has its own crit chances, in percentages:

* Pistol at 1 pace: <Code>action_chance = {constants.PISTOLS_KILL_AT_STEP_1}%</Code>
* Pistol at 10 paces: <Code>action_chance = {constants.PISTOLS_KILL_AT_STEP_10}%</Code>
* Pistol chances between 1 and 10 paces are interpolated.
* Blades crit chance is constant: <Code>action_chance = {constants.BLADES_CRIT}%</Code>

### Archetype Crit Bonus

This bonus is given according to the duelist **Archetype**:

* üëë Honourable: <Code>max_crit_bonus = {constants.CRIT_BONUS_LORD}%</Code>
* üÉè Trickster: <Code>max_crit_bonus = {constants.CRIT_BONUS_TRICKSTER}%</Code>
* üë∫ Villainous: No crit bonus
* Calculated according to their **archetype level**. Level `10` equals total bonus.
* Bonus is capped at total duels. For example, a duelist with 5 finished duels will get a maximun bonus of `5%`.

```rust
crit_bonus = max_crit_bonus * (archetype_level / 10)
crit_bonus = min(crit_bonus, total_duels)
```

### Match Crit Bonus

This bonus is given on the **Pistols Round** according to the duelist **archetype** and **shooting order**.

* üëë Honourable: <Code>match_bonus = {constants.EARLY_LORD_CRIT_BONUS}%</Code> when shooting **early**.
* üÉè Trickster: No match bonus
* üë∫ Villainous: <Code>match_bonus = {constants.LATE_VILLAIN_CRIT_BONUS}%</Code> when shooting **late**.

The rationale here is to give an extra strategy for **Honourable vs. Honourable** and **Villainous vs. Villainous** duels.

### Trickster Penalty

Tricksters do not have match crit bonus, but they inflict a penalty to other archetypes.

* üëë Honourable: <Code>trickster_penalty = {constants.TRICKSTER_CRIT_PENALTY}%</Code> when opponent is Trickster.
* üÉè Trickster: No penalty
* üë∫ Villainous: <Code>trickster_penalty = {constants.TRICKSTER_CRIT_PENALTY}%</Code> when opponent is Trickster.

### Crit Decision

* Bonuses and penalties are applied to action chances
* To avoid over-penalties, final chances will never be less than half the action chance.

```rust
crit_chances = (action_chance + crit_bonus + match_bonus - trickster_penalty)
crit_chances = max(crit_chances, action_chance/2)
```

* Dices roll... üé≤
* Success if `crit_chances <= dice_value`
* Apply damage and block to opponent's health.

```rust
health = previous_health - max(damage - block, 0)
```


## 3. HIT Dice Roll

> If **CRIT fails**, a new dice rolls for a chance to **HIT** the opponent.

### Action Hit Chances

Each action has its own hit chances, in percentages:

* Pistol at 1 pace: <Code>action_chance = {constants.PISTOLS_HIT_AT_STEP_1}%</Code>
* Pistol at 10 paces: <Code>action_chance = {constants.PISTOLS_HIT_AT_STEP_10}%</Code>
* Pistol chances between 1 and 10 paces are interpolated.
* Blades hit chance is constant: <Code>action_chance = {constants.BLADES_HIT}%</Code>

### Archetype Hit Bonus

This bonus is given according to the duelist **Archetype**:

* üëë Honourable: No hit bonus
* üÉè Trickster: <Code>max_hit_bonus = {constants.LETHAL_BONUS_TRICKSTER}%</Code>
* üë∫ Villainous: <Code>max_hit_bonus = {constants.LETHAL_BONUS_VILLAIN}%</Code>
* Calculated according to their **archetype level**. Level `10` equals total bonus.
* Bonus is capped at total duels. For example, a duelist with 5 finished duels will get a maximun bonus of `5%`.

```rust
hit_bonus = max_hit_bonus * (archetype_level / 10)
hit_bonus = min(hit_bonus, total_duels)
```

### Trickster Penalty

Tricksters do not have match hit bonus, but they inflict a penalty to other archetypes.

* üëë Honourable: <Code>trickster_penalty = {constants.TRICKSTER_HIT_PENALTY}%</Code> when opponent is Trickster.
* üÉè Trickster: No penalty
* üë∫ Villainous: <Code>trickster_penalty = {constants.TRICKSTER_HIT_PENALTY}%</Code> when opponent is Trickster.

### Injury Penalty

A penalty is inclicted on injured duelists, from an **early pistol shot** or from **blades**.

* Pistols and blades: <Code>penalty_per_injury = {constants.HIT_PENALTY_PER_DAMAGE}%</Code>

```rust
injury_penalty = (penalty_per_injury * injury_taken)
```

### Hit Decision

* Bonuses and penalties are applied to action chances.
* To avoid over-penalties, final chances will never be less than half the action chance.

```rust
hit_chances = (action_chance + hit_bonus - trickster_penalty - injury_penalty)
hit_chances = max(hit_chances, action_chance/2)
```

* Dices roll... üé≤
* Success if `hit_chances <= dice_value`

### Damage Inflicted

Pistols injury is calculated from a lethal chance:

* Pistol at 1 pace: <Code>lethal_chance = {constants.PISTOLS_LETHAL_AT_STEP_1}%</Code>
* Pistol at 10 paces: <Code>lethal_chance = {constants.PISTOLS_LETHAL_AT_STEP_10}%</Code>
* Pistol chances between 1 and 10 paces are interpolated.
* The hit dice result is used to 
* If `hit_chances <= lethal_chance`, inflicts `2` injury points, else just `1`.

Blades damage are constant, according to the [Blades Damage table](/pistols/blades-round#blades-damage).

* Apply damage and block to opponent's health.

```rust
health = previous_health - max(damage - block, 0)
```




## 4. Late Dice Rolls

If an **Early Duelist** does not kill the opponent, steps 2 and 3 are repeated for the **Late Duelist**,
rolling **Crit** and **Hit** dices in the same order as above.

A Late Duelist chances can be reduced if injured during the early strike!
