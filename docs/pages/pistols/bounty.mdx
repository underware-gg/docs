# Bounty (DRAFT)

## Concepts

### Players vs. Duelists

**Player** is a single individual who plays the game using a [Controller](https://cartridge.gg/controller) account.

**Duelists** are playable characters, owned by **Players**.

A Player's first **Duelist** is free Additional **Duelists** can be created for **100 LORDS**.


### What is üí∞BOUNTY?

**BOUNTY** is the ranking system for Duels. The higher a **BOUNTY**, the greater a Duelist is.

**BOUNTY** is a game currency, always owned by **Duelists** (they are **Token Bound**). Every Duelist has their own **BOUNTY** balance.

**Players** also have a **BOUNTY** balance, automatically generated from the sum of all of their **Duelists** balances.

**BOUNTY** can never be transfered between **Duelists** or **Players** (they are **Soul Bound**). But when **Duelists** are transfered between **Players**, their **BOUNTY** comes along.


### Where does BOUNTY comes from?

Every new Duelist is created with **1,000 BOUNTY** and **3 ‚ù§Ô∏èLives**.

When Duelists enter a Duel, a percentage if their **BOUNTY** can be earned by the winner, according to their remaining lives.

| Remaining Lives | Bounty if killed   |
|-----------------|:------------------:|
| 3 or more       | 20%                |
| 2               | 50%                |
| 1               | 100% +1‚ù§Ô∏è            |


### Bounty only goes up.

The total amount of **BOUNTY** on Duelists (and in circulation) never decreases.

When a Duel is lost, the defeated balance remains the same, while their pledged **BOUNTY** amount is issued to the winner's balance.

Example:
* Duelist A has 2,000 BOUNTY and 3 Lives, pledging 20% (400 BOUNTY).
* Duelist B has 1,000 BOUNTY and 2 Lives, pledging 50% (500 BOUNTY).
* If A wins, it goes to 2,500 BOUNTY. B still keeps 1,000.
* If B wins, it goes to 1,400 BOUNTY. A still keeps 2,000.


### Extra BOUNTY (???)

Certain actions can earn a Duelist extra **BOUNTY** on a win.

| Condition       | Extra Bounty  |
|-----------------|:-------------:|
| End with Full Health | 10%           |
| Perfect Dodge        | 20%           |


### Extra Lives

As an incentive for challenges between high and low BOUNTY Duelists, if one Duelist pledges 100% or more than their opponent, they earn an extra **Life** on a win.

Taking the last life of a Duelist also earns an extra **Life**.
